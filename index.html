    <marquee direction="left" width="100%" scroll-amount="12"> On this website, you will learn about all kinds of
        mythology from 4 different civilizations! Some of the civilizations' mythologies are similar, and some are
        different. Be sure to spot these similarities and differences while exploring this website! </marquee>

        <h1> Welcome </h1>
        <p id="intro"> Have you ever wondered what the entire mythology of a civilization was? I'm sure that you know at
            least some
            parts
            of, for example, Greek mythology, but have you ever really delved into the details of Greek mythology? For
            example, did you know that when Perseus, the Greek hero, cut off Medusa's head, her sons, Pegasus, the
            winged horse, and Chrysaor, "golden blade" or "He who holds a golden sword", were born from the wound?
            That's crazy! I hope you enjoy exploring this guide to these civilizations' myths! </p>

        <h1> Greek Mythology </h1>
        <p> Greece was the foundation of Roman society, and many aspects of Roman life were influenced by Greek culture,
            including their mythology! Because of this, you will find many similarities between their mythologies.
            (Mostly only the names of the gods will be different!) I hope that you learn something from this section!
        </p>

        <p> As you can see from the picture above, the family tree of Greek mythology is extremely complicated. First
            off, everything came from the void of Chaos, who gave birth to 5 deities, one of them being Gaea, the
            goddess of the Earth. Gaea gave birth to children on her own, then married one of her sons, Ouranus, and
            bore
            the Titans, Gigantes, and the Cyclopes. Then, Cronus took over as the ruler of the universe, and married his
            sister Rhea, and she bore the first generation of the Olympians, Hades, god of the dead/Underworld, Demeter,
            goddess of farming, Hestia, goddess of the hearth, Poseidon, god of the sea, Hera, goddess of marriage,
            and, of course, Zeus, god of the sky. Rhea hides Zeus, while the rest of his siblings are swallowed by
            Cronus, who was
            afraid
            that his power will be taken from him. In the end, Zeus and the Olympians won the battle against the Titans,
            along with the Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires, another one of Gaea's children. After winning the battle,
            the gods married and gave birth amongst themselves, as shown in the picture. Gaea was furious at Zeus for
            imprisoning the Titans, since they were her children as well, so she unleashed the monsters Typhon and
            Echidna, who were the father and mother of all monsters. Zeus eventually won over them, and there was peace
            on Mount Olympus, where the gods lived, for some time. The gods and goddesses were immortal, with ichor that
            flowed through their veins, and they ate ambrosia and nectar as food. Heroes also existed in Greek
            mythology, some that you
            may already know, including Heracles (more commonly known as Hercules), Perseus, and Theseus. There were
            also
            many other monsters
            in Greek mythology, including Scylla, Charybdis, harpies, Hydra, the Nemean Lion, Ladon, the Chiimera, the
            Sphinx, Python, and so many more! This paragraph was just a brief overview of Greek mythology. Keep in mind
            to research more on the topic if you are interested, and you should probably also study the image, just so
            you know the family tree of the Greek gods!

    <section id="roman_mythology">
        <h1> Roman Mythology </h1>
        <p> Like I mentioned earlier, Roman mythology was based largely on Greek mythology. The Romans made their own
            system of gods, with different personalities and names, but they were the deities of the same things. For
            example, Zeus became Jupiter, and Poseidon became Neptune. (You may have also realized that our planets are
            named after Roman gods!) </p>
        <img id="roman"

            class="img-responsive">
        <p> Honestly, this paragraph is basically the same as the Greek mythology summary, since only the names have
            changed. Terra and her siblings were made from Chaos, and she married Uranus, her son, and gave birth
            to the Titans, Cyclopes, and the Hecatoncheires, as well as others. Terra plotted against Uranus, because he
            imprisoned some of their children in Tartarus, the pit. Saturn, one of the Titans, ruled the
            universe through the Golden Ages. Ops, his wife, gave birth to six children, Pluto, god of the
            Underworld/dead, Ceres, goddess of farming, Neptune, god of the sea, Vesta, goddess of the hearth, Juno,
            goddess of marriage, and Jupiter, god of the sky, and he swallowed them all,
            except for the last child, Jupiter, which Ops hides through her mother, Terra's instructions.
            Jupiter grew up
            and overthrew Saturn through a fierce battle, in which he freed his siblings, and Terra's other children.
            Jupiter ruled over the world after he imprisoned the Titans in Tartarus. Jupiter had many children with
            other goddesses, as well as mortals. The other gods had many children as well, and the Olympians ruled over
            the world. Like the Greek gods and goddesses, the Roman deities also had ichor in their veins, and ate
            ambrosia and nectar. There were also beasts in Roman mythology, but with different names. For example,
            satyrs were
            fauns, the Furies were the Dirae, and so on so forth. Keep in mind that this family tree might not be the
            full family tree of the Roman gods, so feel free to research on your own!

        <h1> Norse Mythology </h1>
        <img id="norse" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f0/09/be/f009be12862e905f61f0d0bb8c940ee5.jpg"
            class="img-responsive">
        <p> Norse mythology is a bit different than the other mythologies, particularly because the Norse gods weren't
            immortal, and could be killed. The Norse people had something of a doomsday in their mythology, known as
            Ragnarök, in which all of the monsters and enemies of the gods would destroy them, and take over the world.
            Odin was considered the father of the Æsir gods, a pantheon of gods, and his sons and daughters became part
            of the Æsir, mostly "warrior" gods, that included Thor, Tyr, Baldur, Heimdall, and more.He was the husband
            of Frigg,
            and
            lived in the
            realm of Asgard, above Midgard, the land of the mortals. There were also the Vanir, gods and goddesses that
            represented fertility, health, wisdom, and the ability to see the future. The most famous, in my opinion, of
            the Vanir, were Frey, god of peace, prosperity, and other similar aspects, and Freyja, his sister, goddess
            of beauty, similar to Aphrodite, in a way. The gods' main enemies were giants in the realm of Jötunheim.
            That's why Odin made a peace treaty with the giants, and raised one of their children, Loki, as a "god" in
            Asgard. Thor and Loki get into many conflicts, but they make up eventually, until Loki kills Baldur, and is
            punshed for his crime. Loki's children are mostly monsters that lead to Ragnarök, including Fenrir,
            Jormungandr, and Hel, goddess of the dead. After Ragnarök happens, all of the gods die except for one, Vidar
            the Silent, one of Odin's sons. He rules the next generation of the Norse gods.

        <p> Nun was the first god/goddess in Egyptian mythology, much like Chaos in Greek mythology. Her, or his,
            children were Khnum and Nit, who
            married to have children, one of them being Ra, the god of the Sun, who became the king of the gods. He made
            Shu and Tefnut, god of the wind, and goddess of rain, respectively. They had children together, Geb and Nut,
            who were the god of the Earth, and goddess of the sky, respectively. (More like the opposite of Greek
            mythology!) They had children, even though Ra forbade them to, so they were punished by being separated for
            the rest of their "lives". Their children were Set, Nephthys, Osiris, Isis, and Horus. Osiris became king
            after Ra, from Isis's trickery and cunning. Set became jealous of Osiris, and he plotted against him. At a
            banquet that he organized, he trapped Osiris in a beautiful coffin. Isis, Osiris's wife, spent a long time
            searching for the
            coffin with her sister, Nephthys, the wife of Set, who agreed to help her. Isis became pregnant with Horus,
            in a different life, and he avenged his father's death by defeating Set and exiling him to the desert. There
            were also many other gods and goddesses, including Tawaret, goddess of pregnancy, Bastet, goddess of cats,
            Anubis, god of the dead (who is not pictured), Ammit, the devourer of souls, etc. Monsters in Egyptian
            mythology included griffins, serpopards, the Bennu (very similar to the phoenix), and many more! </p>
